Put your fallback background images here. Suggested names used by the app:

- fallback-dark-1.jpg, fallback-dark-2.jpg, fallback-dark-3.jpg
- fallback-light-1.jpg, fallback-light-2.jpg, fallback-light-3.jpg
- fallback-openai-1.jpg, fallback-openai-2.jpg, fallback-openai-3.jpg

You can add more images and update the lists in `src/theme/backgrounds.js`.

Notes
- Images are used as a blurred, low-opacity glass-morph layer.
- Large images are fine; they are blurred and slightly panned for motion.
- Screenshots directory on the server can also be used via env `BG_SCREENSHOTS_DIR`.
